        <h1>Story</h1>
        <p>
          Graduating from Gainesville dev academy as well as being first self taught has cause me to see the imporantance of knowing the practical side of programming as
           well as the theory behind why.
           <br></br>
          Growing up with a passion for Games, Astronomy and science fiction have caused me to have a significant intrest in all forms of technology especially computers.
          <br></br>
         I hope we can work together in whatever ambition or product you need as well as bridging the gap for others to help them in their personal development education.
